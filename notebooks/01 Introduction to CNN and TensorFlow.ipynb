    "# Introduction to CNN and TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial gives a very brief introduction of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and TensorFlow. Comparing with existing tutorials on TensorFlow and CNN, which are enormous, this tutorial focuses more on the mechanism behind TensorFlow. We elaborate based on the concept of computation graph, which TensorFlow uses to define, execute, and restore computation, not only for CNN, but also for general tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is organised as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Basic TensorFlow usage](#Basic-TensorFlow-Usage)\n",
    "2. [Computaion Graph in TensorFlow](#Computation-Graph-in-TensorFlow)\n",
    "3. [CNN as computation graph](#CNN-as-Computation-Graph)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our tutorial is targeting at the **graph execution** mode of TensorFlow, in contrast to **eager execution**, which is introduced by recent TensorFlow releases to perform computation on-the-fly, without building the computation graph at first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the **inference** task is covered in this tutorial.\n",

    "TensorFlow is, on the one hand, a famous machine learning framework on which developers can easily build their models, while on the other hand, a **Domain-Specific Language** (DSL) embedded in Python. As a DSL, TensorFlow provides *primitives*, or APIs, to construct computation graphs for machine learning models. Therefore, in this tutorial, we introduce TensorFlow as a programming language: we first present elements of a typical programming language from TensorFlow, such as syntax, variables, data types, literals, and operators; next, show how a program constructed by TensorFlow can be executed; in the end, there will be a short list of tips and tricks about using TensorFlow.\n",

A CNN can be viewed as a special computation graph that contains **convolutional layer**, which is `tf.nn.conv2d` in TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/conv2d). Details in the principles of convolutional layer can be accessed in this [tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#conv). \n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical CNN, the input and output of each layer are **feature maps**, which are conventionally 3-D tensors (or 4-D if you use batched input). A feature map can be seen as a multi-channel image, which can represent natural image or features extracted from the latent space. The shape of each feature map is $H\\times W \\times C$, in which $H$ and $W$ are height and width of a spatial feature map, and $C$ is the number of image channels. A convolutional layer performs 2D convolution in each spatial feature map, and sum the results together for different output channels. Besides convolutional layer, max pooling layer is also important to reduce the size of feature maps to extract features at higher levels.\n",

    "In this exercise, you are encouraged to visualize the intermediate feature maps after each **convolutional** layer and **max-pooling** layer. We build the skeleton in the following code snippet. You should finish the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Correctly identify the `end_point` tensors for all convolutional layers and max-pooling layers. These tensors can be viewed as the outputs of those layers.\n",
    "2. Collect the values of these tensors based on an input test image. You can select an image from the test dataset (`mnist.test.images`).\n",
    "3. For each tensor value, you can get the 2D image of any channel of the tensor. Hint: a tensor value is a NumPy `ndarray`.\n",
    "4. Visualize the 2D image by `plt.imshow` (https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html)."
